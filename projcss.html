            <br><hr><br>
            <p>Hello! I'm Pranati Hazela, an enthusiastic and driven undergraduate student pursuing Electrical Engineering at IIT BHU. With a natural curiosity and a passion for problem-solving, I've always been fascinated by how technology can be used to understand, model, and improve the world around us. My journey into the world of engineering has been both challenging and rewarding, and it has led me to explore the dynamic fields of coding, data science, and machine learning.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Over time, I've developed a solid foundation in programming languages like Python and C++, and I've worked on various projects that involve data analysis, basic ML algorithms, and creative coding tasks. I take special interest in building solutions that merge theoretical concepts with real-world applications. For me, it's not just about writing code — it's about thinking critically, learning continuously, and making something meaningful.</p>
            <br>
            <p>At IIT BHU, I've had the opportunity to immerse myself in a vibrant learning environment surrounded by brilliant minds. I enjoy participating in technical events, collaborative projects, and online communities that foster learning beyond the classroom. These experiences have shaped me into a more adaptive and thoughtful learner.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Beyond my academic interests, I'm a creative soul. I love writing, especially poetry and personal essays, which allow me to explore emotions and ideas outside the technical realm. I’m also deeply interested in communication, culture, and language — and I find joy in learning new things just for the sake of it. Whether it's understanding how a neural network works or discovering a new form of art, I’m always eager to dive in.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Looking ahead, I aspire to work in spaces where technology and ethics meet — solving real-world problems with intelligence, empathy, and innovation. I believe in the power of tech to make lives better, and I'm excited to contribute to that future, one project at a time.</p>

                <h3>Rock Paper Scissors</h3>
                <p>This is a basic Rock-Paper-Scissors game I made using Python, with no front end—just backend logic. The user plays through the terminal by entering their choice,
                     and the computer randomly picks its move. It then compares both choices and announces
                     the winner. It was a fun way to get comfortable with conditionals, loops, and working with Python's random module.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="proj" style="background-color: #a99db2;">
                <h3>Weather App</h3>
                <p>This is a backend-only weather app I made using Python. It takes a city name from the user through the terminal and 
                    fetches current weather data using an API. It then displays information like temperature and weather condition.
                    The project helped me learn how to use APIs and handle JSON data in Python.</p>

                <h3>GIF Maker</h3>
                <p>A Python project that creates GIFs by combining multiple images into an animation.
                    It uses built-in modules and possibly other lightweight libraries to process image files and generate the final GIF.
                    The tool allows basic control over frame order and speed, showcasing file handling and automation skills in Python.</p>
